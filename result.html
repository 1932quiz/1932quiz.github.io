The Nazi Party aimed to unite the German people, while excluding people of other ethnicities and races. Considering Germans to be the \"Aryan master race,\" Nazis attempted to strengthen it through eugenics, racial purity, indoctrination and service to the state. Additionally, the Nazi Party emphasized the importance of strict societal roles, strength, unity and discipline. The Nazis blamed Jews for betraying Germany and forcing it to surrender in the Great War. Economically, the National Socialists believed that strict government control over the economy was essential for the nation to become self-reliant, strong and prosperous.";

The Center Party was mostly in support of Parliamentary Liberal Democracy, but some elements in the party believed that an authoritarian state was necessary to protect the position of the Church.";

Due to it being founded by the Soviet Commintern, the party was officially Stalinist, but generally consisted of many radical Communists. The Communists considered themselves to be the only anti-fascists and were hostile to every other major party in the Reichstag. The Communist Party deeply despised Liberal Democracy, which pushed them to ally with the Nazi Party to attack the Social Democrats. The Communists strongly believed in protecting labor rights as well as establishing a Socialist economic system.";
